sortfiles.py
Version 1.0

About: 
This program's primary feature is to move files of a specific file type into a sub folder within the file they currently reside. For example: If one has both .jpeg and .CR2 (raw) file types and wish to sort them, this program can move the CR2s into a sub folder within. Another example would be to separate .pdf from .docx etc. This is customizable.

Running: 
This program is written for the Python 3 environment. It is a command-line program with a basic text-UI. At this time the script must be run from within the directory that holds the files that will be moved.

System, Development and Testing:
This program was written and tested on MacOS High Sierra V.10.13.3 using Python Version 3.6.5. 
With little to no modification, this program should be able to be run on any operating system with Python 3.
